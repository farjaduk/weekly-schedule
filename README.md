# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Website acts as a scheduling calender app for a busy work day! You can find today's date at the top of the screen.

It is split into hourly increments from 9am to 5pm. Any entries can be made for those hour blocks.
The entries will be stored and show up even after the website is refereshed. 
The scheduler will be color coordinated with grey = hour block that is passed, green = hour blocks that are in the future, and red = hour block user is in right now.
